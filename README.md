# Personalized Health Assistant (PHA)
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
PHA is a smart health assistant that utilizes artificial intelligence to provide personalized health recommendations and track individual well-being, aiming to improve access to personalized healthcare and promote healthier lifestyles.

# Background
Problem: Limited access to personalized healthcare and lack of continuous health monitoring lead to preventable health issues.
Frequency: The problem is prevalent worldwide, affecting people from different backgrounds and age groups.
Motivation: The desire to leverage technology, specifically AI, to enhance healthcare and well-being for everyone.
Importance: This topic is crucial as it can potentially save lives, reduce healthcare costs, and improve overall quality of life.

# How is it used?
Users can interact with the PHA through a mobile app or a web platform. They input their health data, such as medical history, vital signs, physical activity, and dietary habits. PHA then employs AI algorithms to analyze the data, identify patterns, and provide personalized health recommendations. The solution is needed in various situations, including self-monitoring, chronic disease management, and general health improvement. Users with different health needs and preferences should be taken into account to ensure inclusivity.

# Data sources and AI methods
Data for PHA comes from various sources, including user inputs, wearable health devices, and medical databases. AI techniques such as machine learning, natural language processing, and image analysis are employed to process and analyze the data effectively.

# Challenges
Limitations: PHA cannot replace professional medical advice and immediate medical attention in emergencies.
Ethical considerations: Ensuring data privacy and transparency in AI-driven recommendations.
What next?
The project could expand by collaborating with healthcare providers to integrate PHA into their services. To move forward, expertise in AI, healthcare, and user experience design would be beneficial.
